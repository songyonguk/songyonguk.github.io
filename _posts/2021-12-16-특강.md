# verse i
Morpheus, Dorpheus, Orpheus
Go eat some walruses
Orifices, Porridges
Morpheus, Morpheus

Going to the Buffet and Walruses
Confidence, Corpseses
Worcestershire sauce
Go into your orifices

Red pill, blue pill
Morpheus, Walruses
Seashells by the Seashorpheus

# outro
Morpheus drinking a forty in a death basket!
